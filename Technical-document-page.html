        <h1>RAKI</h1>
        <section class="main-section" id="Etymology_of_Rakı"><header><p>Etymology of Rakı</p></header>
            <li><code>The term raki entered English from Turkish rakı. The Arabic word arak, means "distilled", other variants being araka, araki, ariki. </code></li>
        <p>The Teleuts, who are a Turkic ethnic group living in Siberia, use the term arakı for wine and other alcoholic drinks.</p></section>

        <section class="main-section" id="History_of_Rakı"><header><p>History of Rakı</p></header>
      <li><code>The production of raki is lost in the depths of time, but it is said that it started in the 14th century on Mount Athos by monks who lived there. Over the years it spread to various areas of Greece, mainly in Macedonia, Epirus, Thessaly and Crete.</code></li>
      <li>Until the last decades of the 20th century, the production of raki was done exclusively "at home", ie there was no mass industrial production. For a long time, a colorless alcoholic beverage has been produced and drunk every year throughout the Mediterranean. It is known by various names: tsipouro, raki, arak, grappa. It is distilled from the by-products of wine, as if man wanted to exploit the vineyard as much as possible.</li>
    <p>During this period, rakı was produced by distillation of grapes pomace (cibre) obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added. If aniseed was not added, it would take the name düz rakı ('straight rakı'), whereas rakı prepared with the addition of gum mastic was named sakız rakısı ('gum rakı') or mastikha.</p>

        <li><code>Raki is traditionally produced from raisin/grape spirit called suma that is distilled to a maximum of 94.55% abv, This spirit is not highly rectified spirit and unlike other flavoured spirits Raki producers consider that the suma has an important role to play in the flavour of Raki itself.</code></li>
<p> The suma, or suma mixed with highly rectified spirit, is diluted with water re-distilled with aniseed and the spirit is collected at around 79-80% abv. The flavoured distillate is diluted and sweetened and rested for minimum of 30 days prior to sale in order to allow the flavours to harmonize. </p>

        <li><code>In Turkey, rakı is the national drink and is traditionally consumed with chilled water on the side or partly mixed with chilled water, according to personal preference. Rakı is rarely consumed without the addition of water. Ice cubes are often added. Dilution with water causes rakı to turn a milky-white colour, similar to the louche of absinthe.</code> </li>
    <p> This phenomenon has resulted in the drink being popularly referred to aslan sütü ('lion's milk').Since aslan ('lion') is a Turkish colloquial metaphor for a strong, courageous man, this gives the term a meaning close to 'the milk for the strong'.</p>

        <li><code>Standard rakı is a grape product, though it may be produced from figs as well. Rakı produced from figs, particularly popular in the southern provinces of Turkey, is called incir boğması, incir rakısı ("fig rakı"), or in Arabic, tini. Tekel ceased producing fig rakı in 1947.</code></li>
    <p> There are two methods of Turkish rakı production. One method uses raisins and other grapes. Yeni Rakı is produced from raisins and Tekirdağ Rakısı is produced from grapes. Fresh grape rakı is like ouzo but has a higher alcohol content.</p>
